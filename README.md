Now you have the main structure and navigation for your website. To continue development, you'll need to create the content for each page based on the information provided in the business plan.

Here's a brief outline of what each page should include:

1. **Home**: An overview of the company, its mission, and its services. You could use a banner with a call-to-action, a brief introduction to the company, and a section highlighting key services or recent projects.
2. **About Us**: Detailed information about the company's background, its values, and its team. You may also include the story behind the company name and the company's competitive advantages.
3. **Services**: A comprehensive list of services offered by the company, with explanations and examples of each. You can divide this into categories such as consulting, custom software development, and digital transformation.
4. **Portfolio**: Showcase completed projects, ideally with images and brief descriptions of the project's scope, technologies used, and client testimonials. You can organize this as a grid or a slideshow.
5. **Blog**: A collection of articles related to the software industry, company news, and other relevant topics. You may use this space to demonstrate the company's expertise and share insights on trends and best practices.
6. **Contact Us**: A contact form allowing visitors to get in touch with the company. Include fields for name, email, phone number, and message. You can also provide the company's contact information, such as email, phone number, and address.

To style the website, you can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or create your own custom styles. For the backend, you can develop API endpoints to manage blog posts, portfolio projects, and contact form submissions, and store the data in a MongoDB database.

Once the development of the website is complete, you can proceed with testing, deploying the site on Azure, and making it live for your clients to access.
